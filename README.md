# Machine-Translator

## Introduction
This project is an English-to-French machine translator that leverages the power of neural networks to accurately translate text from English into French. The model was trained on a large corpus of bilingual text data to capture the nuances of both languages, ensuring that translations are not only correct but also contextually appropriate. The goal of this project is to provide a reliable translation tool that can be used in various applications, from language learning to real-time communication.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
   - Develop a High-Quality Translator: Create a machine translation model capable of accurately translating English text into French while preserving the meaning and context.
   - Leverage Neural Networks: Utilize advanced neural network architectures to enhance the translation quality and handle the complexities of natural language.
   - Ensure Contextual Accuracy: Focus on translating sentences in a way that maintains the original context, ensuring that the translations are both natural and meaningful.

## Requirements
Ensure  you have the following dependencies installed:
   - Python 3.x
   - keras
   - numpy
   - scikit-learn
   - tensorflow

## Evaluation
The performance of the final model was evaluated using sparse categorical cross-entropy, and the model was judged based on its accuracy levels
- Sparse categorical cross-entropy: Computes the measure of randomness in the probability distiributions between labels and predictions
